# alderman-vote-tracker
Board of Alderman Vote Tracker for City of St. Louis

This project began at #CodeAcross 2015 and details are on the #CodeAcross wiki here: [https://github.com/OpenDataSTL/codeacross2015/wiki/Board-of-Alderman-Vote-Tracker](https://github.com/OpenDataSTL/codeacross2015/wiki/Board-of-Alderman-Vote-Tracker)

Right now, big focus is on liberating the vote data from City Journal PDFs - these should be saved as .csv files in /data/.

Below is a proposed format for tracking the vote data.  It is very possible additional fields will need to be tracked - if you start digging into the City Journals and realize this format is not sufficient, please suggest changes!

| City Journal Vol | City Journal Issue | Board Bill # | Vote Date | Vote Type | Alderman Last Name | Vote |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|--------------------|------|
|  |   | can xref this w/ stuff later |  | type = committee, perfection, final passage | can xref w/ contact info later | vote = yes, no, present |
